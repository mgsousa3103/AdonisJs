## Adonis API application

This is the boilerplate for creating an API server in AdonisJs, it comes pre-configured with.

1. Bodyparser
2. Authentication
3. CORS
4. Lucid ORM
5. Migrations and seeds

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/mgsousa3103/AdonisJs.git`
2. Move yourself to the appropriate directory: `cd AdonisJs`

#### Getting started with the application

For this project you will need [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) on your machine. I used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to install them.

1. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. Access the `.env` file and change the settings. Look at the `.env.example` file if in doubt.
3. Run your Postgres and Redis database
4. Run `adonis migration:run` to make the migrations
5. Run `adonis serve --dev` to start the application
6. Use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) as a frontend interface to interact with the API
